    <h1>How I got here</h1>
        <img src="../media/MSDMEGI_EC008_H.JPG" class="img1" alt=hummus>
        <p>High School for me was a time that was never-ending, at least so I thought. 
        I was trapped in a place where everyone was in a clique, and if you weren't in one, you were made to feel like you did not belong.
        Four years is a long time to feel unwelcome, unwanted, excluded, and small. The funny thing is that a lot of people in high school hate that high school is cliquey, but because of the deep-rooted culture that has always been, 
        it never changes.</p>
        <p>I wish I knew what I know now. I wish I didn't fall into the trap of caring if you were in a clique or not. Now, in college, I can say it has been such a welcoming experience where I find people who are like me or not like me.
        In college, you meet new people every day and there are so many people to be friends with or decide not to be friends with but that is okay here.
        College is all about finding who you are and who you want to become. I can say that college has helped with my social well-being and my overall confidence.</p>
