    <h1>Isabel's Bio</h1>
        <img src="../media/EmpireStateNewYokCity.jpg" class="img1" alt=hummus>
        <p>My name is Izzy Olson and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying Public Relations at the Newhouse School of Communications. 
        At first, I was looking into studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism, but I finalized my decision at the end of my freshman year to pursue Public Relations. 
        Iâ€™m interested in the consumer or fashion related area of Public Relations.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I do acrylic paintings and sell them to friends. 
        I also sell sweatshirts that I design (I bleach dye them and iron on patches). 
        My favorite tv shows are Breaking Bad, That 70s Show, and Criminal Minds. Some other hobbies I enjoy are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>kick-boxing</li>
            <li>volunteering at my favorite non-profit, Family Promise</li>
            <li>hanging out with my friends</li>
        </ul>
